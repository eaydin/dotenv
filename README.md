# dotenv
Manipulate .env files in Python

## Motive

There are numerous .env handlers for Python out there, yet none of them answered my needs so I wrote a quick-dirty solution. This may or may not be what you need, I encourage searching for alternatives before using it.

## Features

* Backup the .env file before operations
* Access .env variables as Python dictionaries
* Add / delete / update values from .env files
* Understand values with = in them
* Ignore (and preserve) comment lines
* Translates whitespaces in KEY names to _ underscores 
* Understands multiple declarations delimited with commas in the same line

## Installation

After cloning the repo, simply install.

```python setup.py install```

## Usage

Import dotenv and create an Environment class

```
>>> from dotenv import dotenv
>>> my_env = dotenv.Environment('/path/to/.env')
>>> for i in my_env.env: print("{0} = {1}".format(i, my_env.env[i]))
...
DB_PASSWORD = supersecret
APP_ENV = local
MAIL_PORT = 2525
MAIL_ENCRYPTION = none
>>> my_env.env['NEW_VALUE']=999
>>> my_env.update_file()
# if for somereason the file is changed
# and you want to refresh your dictionary
>>> my_env.refresh_env()
```

## Comments

* Lines starting with # ; and // are considered comments and are ignored.
* Comments are saved in an alternative list to be preserved after re-writing.
* The order of comments are NOT preserved. All comments are moved to the top of the file, with an empty line following them to seperate from the KEY=VALUE pairs
* Comments cannot be in the same line with the declarations (meaning, ```DB_USER=localhost # this is databaseusername``` is illegal)

## Declarations
* This is a valid declaration:
```USER1, USER2, USER3 = localhost```
All variables in that line will be "localhost"
* This is also valid
```DO_BACKUP, DO_LOGROTATE```
Notice there aren't any = signs, in this case, both variables are set to TRUE.
* On the other hand, the following case would leave the variables unset:
```DO BACKUP, DO LOGROTATE=```
Note that there is an equal sign at the end, meaning they won't end up as ```True``` values automatically.
Also note that there are no underscores between words, even though each key is seperated by a comma. The dotenv script will translate these whitespaces into underscores, resulting ```DO_BACKUP=```Â and ```DO_LOGROTATE=```
